Screen sharing was added in [SIPML5 1.3.203](Downloads.md) and requires Chrome 26+. Using Chrome 26+ you can share your screen/desktop with any SIP client supporting video (Firefox, iOS, Android, WP8...). <br />
We highly recommend using [webrtc2sip](http://webrtc2sip.org) when the remote party is not chrome. <br />

To use screen sharing you must:
  * Enable it on chrome 26+:
    1. Open <i>chrome://flags</i> in your browser
    1. Enable flag <i>"Enable screen capture support in getUserMedia()"</i>
    1. Restart your browser
  * Use <i>https://</i>. If you don't have one, try https://ns313841.ovh.net/call.htm
